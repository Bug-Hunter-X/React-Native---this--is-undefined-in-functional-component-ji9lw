This error occurs when using a functional component in React Native and attempting to access the `this` keyword.  In functional components, `this` is undefined.  The error typically manifests as `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setState')` or a similar message when trying to use `this.setState` within a lifecycle method (which doesn't exist in functional components).
